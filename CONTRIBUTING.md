# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome! Bear in mind that this project is intended to be a starter site only, not a true blogging platform, so we don't want to add too many features that could complicate someone getting started with their own CRUD app.

### Pull Requests
When submitting pull requests, make sure you've made your changes to a new branch you've created. This makes managing pull requests much easier for the maintainer and will result in your pull request being reviewed more quickly.

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [snipe/laravel4-starter](https://github.com/snipe/laravel4-starter) repository!

### Tests
The original repo this starter site came from did not have any test cases. We're working on fixing that, and would appreciate it if you include test cases wherever possible for any new features you introduce. **We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter) for testing, and if your pull request breaks the build, it won't be accepted**.

### Contact
If you have questions about this project, you can reach me at snipe@snipe.net, or on Twitter at [@snipeyhead](https://twitter.com/snipeyhead).

### The Laravel Framework
Please submit issues and pull requests for the Laravel framework itself (not specific to this sample application) should be made on the [laravel/framework](http://github.com/laravel/framework) repository.
